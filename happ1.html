        <h5>What Is Anger?</h5>
        Anger is an intense emotion you feel when something has gone wrong or someone has wronged you. It is typically characterized by feelings of stress, frustration, and irritation. Everyone feels anger from time to time. It’s a perfectly normal response to frustrating or difficult situations.

        Anger only becomes a problem when it’s excessively displayed and begins to affect your daily functioning and the way you relate with people. Anger can range in intensity, from a slight annoyance to rage. It can sometimes be excessive or irrational. In these cases, it can be hard to keep the emotion in check and could cause you to behave in ways you wouldn’t otherwise behave.
        <h5>Characteristics</h5>
        When we are angry our body goes through certain biological and physiological changes. Examples of biological changes your body might go through include: 
        <ul>
          <li>Increased energy levels</li>
          <li>Raised blood pressure</li>
          <li>Increase in body temperature</li>
          <li>Increased muscle tension </li>
        </ul> 
        <h5>Complications</h5>
        Anger is a completely normal and typically healthy emotion. However, it can be detrimental to both your emotional and physical health when you lose control of it. When you are angry your body goes through some physiological and biological changes.

        Your heart rate quickens and your blood pressure spikes. Your body also releases hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline. Putting your body through these changes often, by repeatedly getting angry, can lead to medical conditions and complications such as:
        <ul>
          <li>High blood pressure </li>
          <li>Diabetes </li>
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Insomnia</li>
        </ul> 
        <h5>Coping</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify the Cause:</li>
          The first step to coping with anger is identifying the root cause of your anger. It could be another emotion—maybe one of fear or loneliness. It could be an altercation you had or an unpleasant thought that came to mind.
          <li>Meditate:</li>
           Meditation is very beneficial in helping to control human emotions. You can start with simple meditation techniques like deep breathing exercises. When faced with a situation that makes you angry, take a second before reacting. You can take several deep breaths to calm yourself or try to count until you feel yourself become calmer. 
           <li>Work Out:</li>
           Exercising isn’t just great for your physical health—it’s also beneficial for your mental health. It’s also a way to channel out emotions like anger in a useful and productive way. Going for a quick run or swim when you are angry could help defuse the emotion.

        </ul>
        Learning to cope with your anger is a skill you can learn. It can also take some time to learn it, so don’t beat yourself up when you find yourself slipping into old habits when you are angry. Go through coping mechanisms that have worked for you and try them again.

        It's important to remember that when expressed properly, anger is a healthy emotion. It can also be beneficial in dangerous situations, as the emotion triggers our fight or flight response. In some cases, this can be helpful in getting us out of a dangerous situation.
